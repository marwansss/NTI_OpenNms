# OpenNMS automated download 



## We created a python script to automate the installation and configrations of OpenNMS Server 
### Note " that this script was created specifically for the CentOS version "

## the first script will install pyenv and initialize it & the second one is to install OpenNMS

## The usage pf OpenNMS
  OpenNMS is a powerful network management platform designed for managing complex networks and . Its primary usage includes:

    1- Network Monitoring: OpenNMS allows you to monitor your network infrastructure, including devices, servers, services, and applications.
    It provides real-time visibility into the performance and health of network components.
    
    2- Fault Management: OpenNMS detects and responds to network faults and outages.
    It can automatically alert network administrators when issues arise, helping to minimize downtime and ensure smooth network operations.

    3- Performance Management: OpenNMS collects performance data from network devices and systems, allowing you to analyze historical trends, identify bottlenecks, and optimize network performance.

    4- Event Management: OpenNMS captures and processes events generated by network devices and systems.
    It can correlate events, filter out noise, and take automated actions based on predefined rules.

    5- Service Assurance: OpenNMS helps ensure the availability and reliability of critical network services and applications.
    It provides comprehensive monitoring and reporting capabilities to track service-level agreements (SLAs) and meet service delivery goals.

  OpenNMS uses SNMP protocol to monitor and manage network devices and services. SNMP is one of the most commonly used protocols for network management.
  OpenNMS can monitor devices that support SNMP, retrieve information such as device status and performance metrics .
